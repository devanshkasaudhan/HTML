            <p>Don’t you just love exploring beautiful and neat sites with a clean user interface? While most of us
                would reply
                with an assertive ‘YES,’ little, do we know the kind of effort and skill that goes into making a website
                attractive and user-friendly. The secret to creating an impressive site is to master the art of
                front-end
                development, and no, it is not as easy as it seems!
            </p>
            <p>However, it is not impossible either. Here are five tips that’ll help you get better in front-end design
                and web
                development.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4 class="h-style">Commenting</h4>
                    <p>Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers, especially for codes that
                        are
                        written by multiple programmers. But remember, commenting is an important part of project you
                        create.
                        With proper comments and organised files its always easier for you or others to jump in and
                        understand
                        where things are at and how they work.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4 class="h-style">Invest In Productive Tools.</h4>
                    <p>The Internet is teeming with a host of web development tools, from browser add-ons to smart
                        plugins, the
                        amount of choices available now is massive! So, why not invest in some really productive web
                        tools
                        that’ll help you improve your front-end designing skills? Tools like Sublime Text, jQuery,
                        Emmet,
                        Bootstrap, and Sass are nothing short of a godsend for web developers.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4 class="h-style">Always Be Curious.</h4>
                    <p>A front-end developer has to keep himself/herself updated continuously with the latest news and
                        innovations in the field. You need to take a proactive stand and learn new things about
                        front-end
                        development from informative blogs and videos. Following are some of the most informative and
                        useful
                        learning sources for front-end developers -</p>

                        <li>front end focus</li>
                        <li>CSS weekly</li>
                        <li>Javascript weekly</li>

                <li>
                    <h4 class="h-style"> Refactor Your Code From Time To Time. </h4>
                    <p>
                        By “refactoring” your code, you’re only enhancing the code without tampering with its
                        functionality. This will improve the quality and readability quotient of your code and the more
                        often you do it, your code will continually be updated into a cleaner and fresher version of
                        what it was before. Apart from that, one of the most significant advantages that refactoring
                        offers is that it ensures your code remains free from plagiarism.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4 class="h-style"> Automate! </h4>
                    <p>
                        As a front-end developer, you already have to take care of minute little details that can get
                        overwhelming at times. You have to invest your time on things like Boilerplate, testing,
                        workflow, dependency management, performance, optimization, build, deployment, and so on.
                        Doesn’t sound easy, right?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Take some steam off yourself and incorporate automation into your workflow. While automation can
                        take care of things such as optimization, testing, etc., you can focus on the core areas of
                        front-end development such as HTML, CSS, creating the client-side software, enhancing the
                        user-experience, and so on. By doing so, not only will your productivity increase, but you will
                        also learn to use your time to focus on the areas that’ll improve the overall functionality of
                        your site. Grunt, Gulp, and Broccoli are some very efficient automation tools.
                    </p>

            </ol>
            <p>
                While these tips will surely help you become a better front-end designer, in the long run, you must
                always remember two things while designing your platform – keep it simple and neat, and don’t forget to
                create your signature style. And for all you peeps interested in making it big in front-end development.
